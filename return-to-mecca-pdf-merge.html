If they are all right then there is only one God and they can only be speaking about the same thing even though they each may have their belief that their way is the only right way.

P0M 00:41, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p><h2><span>Spelling in title and within article</span></h2><p>I realize that this question has been discussed, but that was back in 2003, and has not really been brought up since. Why do we have a contradiction within the article? Why is the article name 'Mecca', while every reference to the city within the article is 'Makkah'? This is absurd: Either we say that one or the other spelling is our 'official' Wikipedian spelling, and we stick with it both in the title and in the article. It makes absolutely no sense to try to sit on the fence by using both within the same article.</p><p>Personally I am strongly in favor of the spelling 'Makkah', since this is the American Government's official spelling of the name. That makes the Naming policy poll inapplicable, since the question posed there was whether the common spelling should out-weigh the <i>foreign country's</i> spelling. Nobody there proposed that we not use the official US spelling of the name. I'm not sure when the State Department changed their official policy: their page on Saudi Arabia was last updated Sept 2004, so maybe it was after the poll.</p><p>My opinion is irrelevant, however. What matters is that the article <b>needs to be standardized one way or the other</b>. It's ridiculous to spell the city one way in the article title and another way throughout the article. — Asbestos   <font color='#808080'>Talk</font> 1 July 2005 11:32 (UTC)</p><dl><dd>Since apparently no-one watches this talk page, I'm perfectly happy to be bold and move the page myself, if only to generate some response.

Consider Cairo. No English speaker would speak about his/her amazing trip to 'Al-Quahirah.' Nor should an English Wikipedia article about the Egyptian capital fall under that heading.

On the subject of Google searches on the two terms, the usage is changing and if you limit searches by date you will find Makkah gaining ground steadily. Also remember that any article that says 'Makkah' will probably also say '(Mecca)' after it - so you can't really count that as a 'Mecca' hit.

If they routinely refer to it <i>in English</i> as Makkah then out of respect that is how we should refer to it as well. I would be just as likely to support changing Confucius to 'Master Kong' if most Chinese actually referred to him that way when speaking in English. Redirects are cheap, and most people may still find it by searching on Mecca, but I believe their preferred transliteration should be honored. As above though, I am willing to consider evidence that this might be more a political stunt than a popular preference, if anyone has such evidence. Dragons flight July 6, 2005 23:48 (UTC)<dl><dd>Is there really any evidence about the actual preference of Arabian people in general on how to spell Mecca/Makkah in English?

I have a question: what happens if a Muslim does not have access to Mecca, and thus cannot make the traditional pilgrimage? Are there any precedents or interpretations in Islamic law regarding such a situation? If so, what is to be done? Thank you very much for your time. Brasswatchman July 31, 2005. 11:07 AM EST.</p><dl><dd>Actually, let me rephrase the question, since I asked it in another talk section. Please understand that I do not intend any offense. I have been wondering, however - has there been any discussion of how Islam might adapt if Mekkah was destroyed? - --Brasswatchman 05:49, August 2, 2005 (UTC)<dl><dd>Utterly destroying a city is harder than you might think. The scorched radioactive Godzilla-torn ruins of Mecca would have just as much religious significance as the intact city does now, and would probably have more emotional significance as a result of the tragedy. Even the glass circle where Mecca once stood would retain that significance. Unless someone unexpectedly invents a bomb capable of blowing up the past or destroying metaphysical religious concepts, Mecca's status as a religious symbol seems safe.</dd><dd>All of this ignores the possibility to Space-Muslims, of course, or some sort of intradimensional Muslims with no way to return; but somehow I feel confident that they would find a way to cope. I wonder, for the intradimensional Muslims--would a pilgrimage to an alternate-dimension Mecca count? Aquillion 11:41, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl><p>It is the location of the holy sites in and around Makkah, rather than the actual buildings and/or relics that are of significance to Muslims. As an example, the Great Mosque surrounding the Kabbah, has been rebuilt in recent years on a much grander scale. Previously the mosque simply enclosed the Kabbah and adjacent sites (such as the Well of Zamzam and the Station of Abraham). The new building is a multistorey complex which has been extended on one side to enclose completely the low hills of Safa and Marwah, between which pilgrims perform an important rite. The grandeur of the new mosque does not in anyway affect the performance of the pilgrimage. If the entire city was to be obliterated, it would still be the location of the Hajj, although performing the rites might be a bit difficult.</p><p>As to Muslims who cannot make the pilgrimage, there are dispensations which have been used in the past. Firstly, the aspiring pilgrim has to satisfy several criteria before going on the pilgrimage (e.g. possession of sufficient wealth, reasonable health, and provisions for the pilgrim's family, in case the pilgrim does not return). For example, if the residents of a remote village were too poor to afford the lengthy and dangerous journey (before jet aircraft and air conditioning), then they could pool their resources and nominate a small party to undertake the Hajj on behalf of the entire village. Thus, all the villagers completed the pilgrimage without actually visiting Makkah.</p><p>The question of Space-Muslims has been partially (but wrongly) answered by the film Pitch Black, where a party of Muslims searches for New Mecca. Instead of undertaking an arduous journey, the Space-Muslim could simply ask forgiveness from God, for not being able to perform the Hajj. 213.104.241.134 22.48, 01 October 2005 (UTC)</p><img src='http://images.alinari.it/img/480/FCC/FCC-F-019878-0000.jpg' alt='Return to mecca pdf merge' title='Return to mecca pdf merge'><dl><dd>In fact the Holy Kaba in Makkah has been destroyed more than once. By the Syrian army in Muharram 64 (Hijri date) for example. As for Space Muslims, there was an article in Arab News a few years ago that addressed this. On another planet you pray towards earth (or towards a vertical line pasing through earth if it is far above or below the horizon.) Prince Sultan Salman Abdulaziz Al-Saud has flown on the US Space Shuttle and managed to pray towards Makkah whilst in orbit.

Because of the distance from Makkah to other cities, Muslims basically stand in straight, parallel lines (called <i>safs</i>) facing Makkah when in salah.

I always wondered what would happen if someone were to build a mosque at the antipodes. Would the <i>safs</i> then be concentric circles facing outwards? Where would the <i>imam</i> stand?

The same is not true, I think, for any of the Christian or Jewish cities mentioned.. They are important, but not in the way that Mecca is to Islam. Mecca's importance to Islam is so great (and specific to that religion) that it rightfully dominates this page. The template is just a sign of that.

There is life in Mecca outside of Islamic ritual and that information probably isn't as easy to come by as the stuff about Islam is..

Also, your attempts to PROVE the antiquity of Mecca by mentioning Diodorus Siculus are basically hearsay. You're quoting a two-hundred year old <i>paraphrase</i> of the text and saying that Gibbon was correct in his speculation that the temple mentioned by Diodorus was the Kaaba. Unless you can give a translation from the Latin of the exact wording used by Diodorus and an opinion by a modern historian that Diodorus' text refers to the Kaaba, you've got nothing. Now if you can quote some Islamic text that claims the connection, we can say that 'some Muslims believe that ..' and then cite Crone against it. You're working from antique hearsay; she reads Latin.

I'd guess that you aren't a classicist, and that you got the quote from some Islamic literature or website.

Islam is not particularly fond of the religious veneration of people or objects, yet the Hajj is required of all Muslims who are financially and physically fit to go. It's odd, since a religion like Christianity (which is big on saints, relics, holy places, and the veneration thereof) but doesn't require pilgrimage to Jerusalem or Bethlehem. I know we have several users from Saudi, so maybe you guys would know. ChildeRolandofGilead 12:44, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p><dl><dd>One of the main aspects of the pilgrimage is to instill in the pilgrims a sense of historical importance of the places they visit - the Kaaba is, according to traditional Islamic belief, the first place to be built to worship a unique creator. The acts of the pilgrimage (the Hajj riruals) are performed to give pilgrims direct experience of important aspects of their religion (for example, the stoning of the devil ritual). The Hajj also gives a sense of unity to the religion - people from many creeds and countries coming to the same place to worship. I hope this sheds some light on your question. Cheers. MP (talk) 19:43, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl><dl><dd><dl><dd>Slightly expanding on this - Every 'ritual' in Hajj comes from history - the Kaba itself was built by Ibrahim and his son, under Hijr Ismail (the small semi circle next to the Kaba) has 24 prophets buried underneath it, the Tawaf was first done by Ibrahim, the Sa'e (walking between Safa and Marwa) was first done by Hagar (Ibrahim's wife), the standing at Arafat was where Adam and Eve met after 200 years of wondering the earth, the stoning of the devil comes from Ibrahim (and Hagar, and Ismail, their son). It is also a duty that man owes god, to prove that they are all the same, regardless of race or gender or what language they speak, and to prove that they are willing to leave behind their material wealth, and their family (it is strongly recommended to do a will before you depart for Hajj).

The attack was said to have been repelled by stones dropped by thousands of birds, followed by a plague. Mainstream historians dismiss most of this tradition as folklore.' I do not know the Qur'an well enough to evaluate this statement. If the Qur'an states that, then it should be trivial to add a footnote with the Sura and Ayat of a particular interpretation.

Clearly Nation of Islam members are allowed in - Malcolm X went to Mecca (I think before his conversion to conventional Islam) and some NoI beliefs are very divergent from conventional Islam e.g. that the white man is a devil created by an evil scientist called Yaqub, and that a new prophet from God appeared in 1920s Chicago. And what about Ahmadis? There are no clear cut boundaries with religions and there are always fringe groups that diverge from the mainstream - such as Jehovas Witnesses and Mormons who aren't generally considered to be Christian but are very very closely related.</p><p>As an additional point, should a young child from a non-Muslim background be allowed into Mecca, since there is a belief that all children are born muslim and 'diverge' as they grow up? And at what age would this divergence occur - presumably earlier if they were from a Hindu background than a Christian one, since only the basic concepts of God would be understood at first - various stories may be learned about Jesus but I would imagine a child would have to be fairly old to grasp the concept of the divinity of Jesus, thereby diverging from Islamic belief. So going back to my original point - should all children be admitted to Mecca, or would the Saudi government not agree with that? A bit of an academic point really since I doubt many people would want to send their children unaccompanied to Mecca.. Milvinder 21:46, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p><p>Please see WP:TALK.

What I'm asking is why it is used in <i>this</i> article when it is not used in the Muhammad article itself, nor in other articles such as Islam and Muslim. It seems from those examples that Wikipedia's style is not to include (PBUH), and if so this article should be brought into line, but I don't want to edit myself in case there are specific reasons of which I am unaware to have (PBUH) in this article but not in the others.

The Bible story tells about Micah as living near the House of the Lord (the Kaabah). If we read the book of Judges we realize that it is not a coincidence that the Port of Laith on the Red Sea south of Juddah, with Juddah the famous port city and Micah the silver idol maker, are gathered in one region.</p><p>The Saudi historians pronounce the name of Jeddah as Juddah which, in the Semitic languages, cannot be written other than JDH. Of course, the Modern Hebrew would consider it as being Judah, or Judea. As for Micah, the old hebrew presented it as MKH and therefore, transfigurated into Micah. In addition, the name of Mecca has never been fairly explained as of its origin. Every time historians talk about the origin of the name they refer to the mention, in the Roman and Greek records, of a township in Arabia called Macoraba. That’s all. No other reference is made for the name of Mecca.</p><p>Briefly, the entire Juddah area is linked to Laith harbor and Mecca where in the deep past, before the Arabs were a pronounced nation, it was a prosperous country of trade and agriculture. At that time Arabia was an Israelite country and up to a large extent, the Israelites were Arabians among Arabs speaking old Arabic. By the time of Moses, there was no Arabic of the later centuries as spoken in the Koran. The old Arabic was what was frozen in the scrolls until after the Deportation, to be read and written by the Rabbis of Babylon. In the mean time, Arabic was evolving through the centuries to crystallize, beautify and clean-up from hiatuses and odd pronunciations with poetry and oral tradition. That is how Arabic had become a separate language from “Hebrew”, which is the old Arabic unfolded in Babylon after centuries of deep sleep inside the scrolls.</p><p>In other words, Arabism emerged after the Israelites had disappeared from the scope of Mecca (Perhaps after Tiglath-pileser III in 733/732 BC deported them to Assyria). This is my theory which involves the search for Assyrian traces in Saudi Arabia. Otherwise we can consider that Arabism has never been inexistent even during the Israelite era in Arabia, but only was eclipsed by the more intense and active tradition of the Israelite life there.</p><p>The explanation is that Micah (Should be read Makkah) was an Israelite living in the Bethel area (The ancient House of God, founded by Abraham). He was a famous figure in that area as a Grand Rabbi so that people gave his name to the area, just like they did in the Harbor area of King Josiah's mother Judaidah on the Red Sea. I do not agree with the local Arabian explanation of the name Juddah as being the 'Grand Mother of all Arabs', as they say. Furthermore, the name of Meccah took another name in the past: Pekkah, which is the name of another Israelite king of Judah, that is how the name is pronounced in the Koran: Bakkah. As for the H suffix, it is a reference to HIM, God the Almighty. Many names in Arabic end with the same H like Warakah, Nuwairah, Makkah, Ubaydah, Ousamah, Buhayrah, Kuraydah, Umayrah, etc..Respectfully,Noureddine (talk) 00:04, 11 August 2008 (UTC)</p><p>Micah the term “house of gods” is used (judges 17:5) if anything it would apply to something pagan.--Standforder (talk) 21:44, 19 December 2008 (UTC) </p><p>Judges 1:1 (m-kh-h) “man”, not place.--Standforder (talk) 21:44, 19 December 2008 (UTC) Judges 1:2, place mountainous region of Ephraim.--Standforder (talk) 21:44, 19 December 2008 (UTC)Laish also called Lashem, not mentioned as a port. – Judges 18:27-29; Joshua 19:47.--Standforder (talk) 21:44, 19 December 2008 (UTC)“Juddah” doesn’t exist in the text is “y-h-dh-h”.--Standforder (talk) 21:44, 19 December 2008 (UTC)“pekka”does not exist in the original Hebrew text it is Pa-qa-ha.--Standforder (talk) 21:44, 19 December 2008 (UTC)</p><p>Bethel existed in the region of Ephraim in ancient Israel (Samaria), and right beside the tribe of Dan, mentioned in the account.--Standforder (talk) 21:44, 19 December 2008 (UTC)</p><p>Here's another etymological theory: 'Mecca' originally meant 'bar house'.
