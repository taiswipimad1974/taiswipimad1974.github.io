He toured and recorded with someone else in 1989, but may have played in Cobb's band before that. I think of it as 'late 1980s' is accurate but not precise; giving an exact year would be precise but possibly not accurate'. EddieHugh (talk) 09:04, 8 May 2014 (UTC)<dl><dd>Good question. On Nir Felder, I determined that he became active in 2005 since he began gigging in NYC after graduation from Berklee that year, and I believe he also says he became active in 2005 in several articles or interviews (going from memory, I could be wrong). But, personally, I'm just curious what is best practice in our music articles? Do we provide precise dates or estimates? For me, 'active' for a musician generally means performing professionally after graduation, but not always. For example, I believe Gabrielle Goodman was gigging professionally while still in school, and so was Kurt Elling, who had played jazz clubs for years before 1995. However, I listed Elling's activity start date as 1995 because that was the year he produced his first professional recording for Blue Note, and he talks about that year being special for his career. So you can see, I have not been very consistent with determining activity dates. Perhaps I'll bring this up with the music project. Thanks, anyway.

You may want to look at other GA/FA articles to see how they handle discussing education in the lead section. WP:LEAD may give you some insight as well. It's notable that he attended The New School. It's not so significant to the reader (in the lead at least) that he was there from 1988 to 1993. I have seen good lead sections mention the date of graduation, if only to provide a chronological context to their post-education career. Although it isn't a GA or FA-Class article, you may want to see how I handled it in the lead section of Kurt Elling. In that lead, I focused more on things rather than dates until it came time to discuss career milestones, at which point I used them sparingly. YMMV.

The phrasing of 'including for performances' sounds stilted and reads as if he played <i>four</i> performances. I'm also seeing more hedging, this time with 'at least 1992'. When did he first lead his own trio? Putting aside that question for a moment, we can say confidently that 'In 1992, he performed at New York's Village Gate leading his own trio.'

Would eliminating the 'and' with 'Redman's band' say the same thing? Also, try to avoid adverbs and terms like 'a lot'. 'Redman's band attracted attention' works fine, but if you want to say 'increased attention' that's fine, too. The 'including for the 1994 album' part sounds clunky. How about, 'Redman's band attracted attention, with the release of their 1994 album Moodswing aiding Mehldau's profile.'

So, there's no need to say 'around', we know he graduated in 1993. And if you don't like those sources, there's quite a few more, such as this one.

I think it works in its current form, but that's because I'm slightly biased as a jazz fan. I wonder if it would still work for non-jazz fans, such as a general reader not quite familiar with the topic. Personally, I like it.

In the latter case, 'The opening is always easy for me, the middle gets more difficult, more of an intellectual process, more trial and error at work, and the end is always difficult for me.'</i><ul><li>The way the quote from Mehldau is setup here relies on attribution established in the previous sentence. Then, when the reader finally comes to 'In the latter case, 'The opening is always easy for me.' the 'me' sounds odd because it is so far from the 'Mehldau himself indicated' attribution 30 words back. As the source shows, Mehldau is in conversation with musician (and writer) Mike Brannon about how he writes and arranges new music. To make this easier to read, something like this might work better: 'In terms of composing new music while improvising, Mehldau compared the process to a game of chess, telling Mike Brannon, 'The opening is always easy for me, the middle gets more difficult, more of an intellectual process, more trial and error at work, and the end is always difficult for me.' I think it would also help to clarify <i>why</i> the end is so difficult for him, as I think it speaks to what many artists go through in the creative process to end a piece. You could paraphrase what he tells Brannon: 'The idea is to end it but leave an opening in there, kind of an escape duct of possibility. All the songs I love have that open-ended feeling, like they never end.' For me, this is very significant, as I find (speaking as the reviewer only) that the best contemporary works of art (music, film, literature, whatever) have this open-ended quality, and there's an enormous amount of literature supporting this observation. Mehldau seems to be making a very profound statement about composition here, and I think it is worth expanding upon.

For example, this sentence is broken up by four sources: <i>They met in 1997,[86] and have three children,[13] the eldest of which is daughter Eden,[23] who was born in 2001.[3]</i> This is not easy on the eyes and chops up the flow. I feel like I'm reading it in a halting, robotic voice. There are ways to prevent this (such as using Harvard refs and selected quotes in the citation) but it goes beyond the scope of the review.
