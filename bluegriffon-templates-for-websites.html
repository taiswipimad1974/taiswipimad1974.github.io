It is a more robust version of the Notepad software that you would find available in Windows by default. That being the case, this is a Windows-only option. It includes things like line number, color coding, hints, and other helpful tools that the standard Notepad application does not have. These additions make Notepad++ an ideal choice for web designers and front end developers.</p><div>of 09</div><h3>Komodo Edit</h3><h4>What We Like</h4><ul><li><p>Extensible through plugins.</p></li><li><p>Customizable appearance.</p></li><li><p>Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p></li></ul><h4>What We Don't Like</h4><ul><li><p>No WYSIWYG editor.</p></li><li><p>Not the best editor for beginners.</p></li></ul><p>There are two versions of Komodo available, Komodo Edit and Komodo IDE.</p><p>is open source and free to download. It is a trimmed down counterpart to IDE.</p><p>Komodo Edit includes a lot of great features for HTML and CSS development. Additionally, you can get extensions to add language support or other helpful features, like special characters.</p><p>Komodo doesn't outshine as the best HTML editor, but it's great for for the price, especially if you build in XML where it truly excels. I use Komodo Edit every day for my work in XML, and I use it a lot for basic HTML editing as well.

Instead of focusing on HTML, Aptana focuses on JavaScript and other elements that allow you to create rich internet applications. That may not make it the best fit for simple web design needs, but if you are looking more in the way of web application development, the tools offered in Aptana may be a great fit.</p><p>One concern about Aptana is the lack of updates that the company has done over the past few years.
