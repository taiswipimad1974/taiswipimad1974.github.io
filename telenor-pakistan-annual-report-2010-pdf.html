The first Norwegian planning for a telegraph were launched within the Royal Norwegian Navy in 1848, but by 1852, the plans were public and the Parliament of Norway decided on a plan for constructing a telegraph system throughout the country. Televerket began by connecting Christiania (now Oslo) to Sweden (Norway was at that time in a union with Sweden) as well as Christiania and Drammen. By 1857 the telegraph had reached Bergen on the west coast via Sørlandet on the south coast, and by 1871 it had reached Kirkenes on the far north coast. Cable connections were opened to Denmark in 1867 and to Great Britain in 1869. The telegraph was most important for the merchant marine who now could use the electric telegraph to instantly communicate between different locations, and get a whole new advantage from better logistics.<sup>[6]</sup></p><h3><span>Telephone</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><p>The first telephone service in Norway was offered in 1878 between Arendal and Tvedestrand, while the first international telephone service between Christiania and Stockholm was offered in 1893. Automation of the telephone system was started in 1920 and completed in 1985. In 1946 the first Telex service was offered, and in 1976 satellite telephone connections to the Norwegian merchant navy, at the time the largest in the world and to oil platforms in the North Sea were made operational. This is the start of Inmarsat Satellite Communication, and formed the first steps to digitalise the telephone network in 1980 - 85.<sup>[7]</sup></p><p>Televerket opened its first manual mobile telephone system in 1966, being replaced with the automatic NMT system in 1981 and the enhanced NMT-900 in 1986. Norway was the first country in to get an automatic mobile telephone system. The digitalGSM system came into use in 1993. The third generation of mobile technology with UMTS system began full operation 2004.<sup>[8]</sup> The Operaweb browser was created in 1994 by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner and Geir Ivarsøy during their tenure at Telenor, and Opera Software was established in 1995 when they went on to continue development of their browser.<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup>.Telenor and Huawei conducted a successful test of 5G with 70 Gbit/s Speeds in Lab environment.<sup>[9]</sup></p><h3><span>Deregulation and internationalisation</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><p>The corporation changed its name to <b>Televerket</b> in 1969. In 1994, then the Norwegian Telecom was established as a public corporation. The telecom sector in Norway, was deregulated in stages between 1994 and 1998. An attempt to merge Telenor with its counterpart in Sweden, Telia, failed in 1999, while both still were owned by their respective governments. On December 4, 2000 the company was partially privatised and listed on Oslo Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. The privatisation gave the company NOK 15,6 billion in new capital, with the Government of Norway owning 77.7% of the company. As of 2014, the Norwegian government holds 53.97% of the Telenor shares directly and another 4.66% through the Pension Fund.<sup>[10]</sup></p><p>In the second half of the 1990s, Telenor began mobile operations in other countries: Russia (1994), Bangladesh, Greece, Ireland, Germany and Austria (1997), Ukraine (1998), Malaysia (1999), Denmark and Thailand (2000), Hungary (2002), Montenegro (2004), Pakistan (2004), Slovakia, Czech Republic, Serbia (2006), Myanmar (2014). Operations in Greece, Ireland and Germany were sold in 1999/2000 and profits were re-invested in emerging markets. In October 2005 Telenor acquired Vodafone Sweden, changing the name to Telenor in April 2006. On 31 July 2006, Telenor acquired 100 per cent share of mobile operator Mobi 63, one of two mobile operations existing in that moment in Serbia for 1.513 billion euros.<sup>[11]</sup></p><p>In March 2018, Telenor sold its business in Southeast Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Montenegro and Serbia) to the PPF Group, for a sum of 2.8 billion euros.<sup>[12]</sup></p><h2><span>Operations</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p>Telenor offers a full range of telecommunication services in Norway, including mobile and fixed telephony as well as Internet access and content. Telenor still dominates the market place in Norway. However, competition has at times been intense in the mobile market and ADSL market, but Telenor remains the largest company in both sectors.<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup></p><p>The group holds a prominent position in the Scandinavian Broadband and TV market, both with regard to the number of subscribers and to the extent of coverage. The TV distribution is branded Canal Digital.<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup></p><p>It formerly provided a range of services related to satellite communication, including voice, television and data before its Telenor Satellite Services division was purchased by Vizada in 2007.<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup></p><p>Telenor Maritime Radio is responsible for the infrastructure for maritime radio communication in Norway, and also includes five manned coast radio stations whose primary purpose is to monitor the maritime radio traffic (over e.g. VHF and MF bands) and to assist marine vessels in distress.<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup></p><p>Telenor Cinclus develops and sells products related to automatic meter reading and other technologies related to machine to machine communication.<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup></p><p>The group also owns 30.2% of Evry (formerly held as 51.8% of the same company under the previous name <i>EDB Business Partner</i>, that offers a wide range of IT-services. The company is listed on Oslo Stock Exchange.<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup></p><p>Telenor has sold a number of divisions after its privatisation, including Bravida,<sup>[13]</sup> the former installation division and Findexa, now part of Eniro that is responsible for telephone directories. The browser vendor Opera Software originated in Telenor's R&amp;D department.<sup>[14]</sup></p><h3><span>Mobile</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><p>At year-end 2005, Telenor held controlling interests in mobile operations in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Serbia, Ukraine, Hungary, Montenegro, Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.

In Europe, the main competition includes Telia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland), Deutsche Telekom (Hungary, Montenegro), and Telekom Austria (Serbia, Bulgaria). Including Europe and Asia, Telenor has been competing with Vodafone in both Hungary and India, though the latter competition ceased as Telenor divested from the Indian market. Axiata is a competitor both in Malaysia and Bangladesh. In 2017, Telenor was the largest operator in terms of market share in Norway and Bangladesh, while the company held second place in Denmark, Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia and Myanmar.<sup>[44]</sup></p><p>Including the wholesale and broadcasting market, Telenor competes especially with Danish TDC, both in Denmark and Norway, where TDC owns the TV distributor Get AS. As a satellite operator, Telenor competes with several operators of geo-stationary broadcasting satellite services in Europe. Telenor has four TV and radio broadcasting satellites over Africa, Europe and the western Indian Ocean, and in the TV distribution market they compete first of all with the Viasat conglomerate (registered in Sweden), and the European distributor giant SES S.A. (Luxembourg). The market for satellite-borne radio and TV transmission is becoming increasingly competitive as more consumers switch to cable and fiber-based TV offers.</p><h2><span>Norwegian Internet Exchange</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p>In June 2007 Telenor announced that it would withdraw from the Norwegian Internet Exchange (NIX). It would allow other internet service providers to connect to Telenor's own exchange point, but wants to be able to charge content providers, like NRK or Schibsted, for prioritised access to their network. The Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority stated they would look at the legality of this move,<sup>[45]</sup> but concluded that the withdrawal from NIX would not negatively affect the Norwegian Internet infrastructure.<sup>[46]</sup> This raised demands that the network division be demerged from Telenor and made a separate company.<sup>[47]</sup> Critics feel that this move compromises the network neutrality of Norway,<sup>[48]</sup> especially since Telenor has a 57% market share domestically.<sup>[49]</sup> Telenor chose not to fulfill their threats, and continue to connect to NIX through a ten gigabit ethernet connection.<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup></p><h2><span>Telenor Youth Forum</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p>Since 2013, Telenor has hosted the annual Telenor Youth Forum in Oslo, during the same week as the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded.

VOIP operations went against the BTRC's (Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission ) rules and as a result Grameenphone's offices were also raided in the process. BTRC claimed that the regulator and government was denied large revenue which Telenor/Grameenphone earned through these activities. Shortly after, Grameenphone's profits fell 32% when BTRC forced Grameenphone to cease VOIP operations.<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup></p><p>A Danish TV documentary has revealed miserable working conditions and environmental violations at companies in Bangladesh that act as suppliers to GrameenPhone. Employees were shown working with hazardous chemicals and heavy metals virtually without protection. Workers were as young as 13 years, a clear violation of child labour laws. The firms were caught allowing polluted waste water to spill into nearby rice fields. And in one case, a worker was killed when he fell into an unsecured pool of acid.<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup></p><p>Telenor opted to reveal some of the findings of the documentary even before it was aired.<sup>[51]</sup></p><p>Nobel Peace Prize recipient and co-owner of Grameenphone, Muhammad Yunus, was considering taking legal action against Telenor, for the company's failure to stamp out the use of child labour by its subcontractors in Bangladesh.
