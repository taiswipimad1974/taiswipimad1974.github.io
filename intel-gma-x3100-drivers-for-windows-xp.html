Windows XP: Download. System & Chipset Drivers. Device Name: Controladora de host universal USB Intel (R) 82801 FB/FBM - 2658. Intel: Supported OS.</p><p>I recently bought a Lenovo Y410 laptop, with an Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 graphics card. When prompted to download Windows updates, I also selected to download an optional update described as follow: 'Intel Corporation driver update for Mobile Intel(R) 965 Express Chipset Family'. Just to give a more complete picture of what I did, I went on to install the programs Avast and Spybot and only after these did I restart my computer. On boot-up Avast ran a check on my system before the OS loads fully (Vista is pre-installed).<br>When Vista has loaded fully, my graphics go haywire; everything assume bigger sizes: the icons, the font, the Start bar menu, and websites need lateral scrolling now. <br>I assumed it had nothing to do with Avast or Spybot, so I thought of 'rolling back' the driver for my display adapter but that option was greyed. So I tried installing the driver from Lenovo's site even though I was prompted that the driver I was downloading is an older version than the one I currently have. <br>Alas, 'big' is still here to stay. Things get more complicated for me because I'm still not used to Vista's layout and the non-familiarity really saps my energy.<br>Any help or suggestions please?</p><div><span>Active</span>10 months ago</div><p>I recently purchased an Intel D2700 MUD motherboard and I cannot find drivers for the Win7 x64 integrated graphics (Intel GMA 3650 aka PowerVR sgs545).

Imagination Technologies refuses to provide 64-bit drivers for its PowerVR graphics cores and is jealous of keeping its own documentation strictly under lock and key and of employing the long arm of the law to insist that its documentation remain Top Secret.</p><p>Plain and simple, folks. This is why Intel CANNOT produce drivers for the GMA3600 for ANY 64-bit operating system platform, whether it be Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, open-source Linux, you name it.

They do not make 64-bit drivers for this GPU, and haven't made any plans to do so public.</p><p>I'm in the same boat. I'm using a Shuttle XS36V with that CPU, now as a low-power server.
