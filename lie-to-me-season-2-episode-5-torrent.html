It originally ran on the Fox network from January 21, 2009 to January 31, 2011. In the show, Dr. Cal Lightman (Tim Roth) and his colleagues in The Lightman Group accept assignments from third parties (commonly local and federal law enforcement), and assist in investigations, reaching the truth through applied psychology: interpreting microexpressions, through the Facial Action Coding System, and body language.<sup>[3]</sup> In May 2009, the show was renewed for a second season consisting of 13 episodes;<sup>[4]</sup> season two premiered on September 28, 2009.<sup>[5]</sup> On November 24, 2009, Fox ordered an extra nine episodes for season two, bringing the season order to 22 episodes.<sup>[6]</sup></p><p>On May 12, 2010, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> reported that <i>Lie to Me</i> received a 13-episode third season pick-up.<sup>[7]</sup><sup>[8]</sup> The third season of <i>Lie to Me</i> was originally set to premiere on November 10, 2010. On September 28, 2010, the date was moved up to October 4, 2010, because of the cancellation of <i>Lone Star</i>.<sup>[9]</sup> On May 11, 2011, Fox canceled <i>Lie to Me</i> after three seasons.<sup>[10]</sup></p><p>The show is inspired by the work of Paul Ekman, the world's foremost expert on facial expressions and a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine. Dr. Ekman has served as an advisor to police departments and anti-terrorism groups (including the Transportation Security Administration) and acted as a scientific consultant in the production of the series. He is also the author of 15 books, including <i>Telling Lies</i> and <i>Emotions Revealed</i>.<sup>[11]</sup></p><ul><li><span>1</span><span>Cast and characters</span></li><li><span>5</span><span>Reception</span><ul><li><span>5.2</span><span>Ratings</span></li><li><span>5.3</span><span>Awards and nominations</span></li></ul></li></ul><img src='http://devxstudik.com/uploads/posts/2010-09/12/34976-0-6606647b370dcc73541dee40750f0e17.jpg' alt='Episode' title='Episode'><h2><span>Cast and characters</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><h3><span>Main</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><div>Tim Roth, who plays the role of lead character Cal Lightman</div><ul><li>Tim Roth as <b>Dr. Cal Lightman</b>, a brilliant expert in the science of body language scientist, especially microexpressions, and founder of The Lightman Group, a private company that operates as an independent contractor to assist investigations of local and federal law enforcement through applied psychology.<sup>[12]</sup> Though often confronted by people's skepticism, Lightman uses any technique he deems necessary to reach the truth, however elaborate or confronting. He is divorced and shares custody of his teenage daughter. He cares deeply about his colleague Gillian Foster; and there is a chemistry between them that has yet to develop into anything more although, in the Season 3 finale, he confesses to his daughter that he loves her. His mother committed suicide while he was still young, an event that led him to discovering and researching microexpressions. There is evidence he was involved with British Intelligence in Northern Ireland.<sup>[13]</sup> Lightman also mentioned interrogating militant suspects recalling his release of one suspect resulted in the shootings of 6 and the deaths of 3 in a murder operation the suspect subsequently carried out. He has also admitted to being an MI6 intelligence agent during the Yugoslav Wars (1994) in an attempt to gain the trust of an intelligence agent that he was interrogating. Lightman is a West Ham United supporter as he mentions himself in Season 2. He can also be seen wearing a Claret and Blue scarf in one of the later episodes of Season 2. The character is based on Dr. Paul Ekman, a psychologist and expert on body language and facial expressions at University of California, San Francisco.<sup>[14]</sup></li><li>Kelli Williams as <b>Dr. Gillian Foster</b>, Dr. Lightman's psychologist colleague in The Lightman Group who analyses patterns of voice, language, and behavior.<sup>[15]</sup> She can be somewhat impulsive but is very professional with the clients and subjects in public. While she occasionally disagrees with some of Lightman's actions, she has an open pact with Lightman: not to let their professional skill interfere with coworkers' personal lives. Her husband's lack of candor often challenges this: When Cal believes her husband, Alec, is cheating on her, he simply ignores what he is seeing, much to Torres's dismay. It is later revealed that he was not cheating on her but was trying to overcome his drug addiction; they promptly divorce. Gillian had adopted a baby (Sophie) who was eventually returned to the birth mother. This character is based on Dr. Maureen O’Sullivan, EmeritusProfessor of Psychology at the University of San Francisco.</li><li>Brendan Hines as <b>Eli Loker</b>, an employee of The Lightman Group. Unlike Torres, whom Lightman calls 'a natural', Loker acquired his skills in 'reading' people through academic education and practice. During Season 1, he also adheres to Radical Honesty and thus rarely lies, even if that makes him appear rude or undiplomatic.<sup>[16]</sup> Lightman demoted him to an unpaid intern after, despite Foster's warnings, he divulged sensitive information to the SEC while working on a case. However, he is later promoted to Vice President, which makes a rift in any developing relationship between him and Torres.</li><li>Monica Raymund as <b>Ria Torres</b>, an employee of The Lightman Group and Dr. Lightman's protégé, who was recognized as a 'natural' while she was still working as a TSA Agent.<sup>[17]</sup> Torres was abused as a child,<sup>[18]</sup> a common pattern among naturals. Though talented and loyal, she lacks academic training and sometimes lets her emotions cloud her judgment. She has a half-sister who was in juvenile prison and is now enrolled at a private school.</li></ul><div>Hayley McFarland, who plays the role of Emily Lightman</div><ul><li>Hayley McFarland as <b>Emily Lightman</b>, Cal Lightman's teenage daughter. Her parents share custody of her, and, while she does not appreciate her father's ability to 'read' her, she does not deny its merit for social screening. She has boyfriends over the series that her father scrutinizes. Though she sometimes gets into trouble and has fake IDs, and, to Lightman's chagrin, has been sexually active, she is generally well behaved and has a loving relationship with her father. (Recurring – Season 1, regular – Seasons 2–3)</li><li>Mekhi Phifer as <b>Ben Reynolds</b>, an FBI Agent who is assigned to and assists the Lightman Group in their investigations, offering armed assistance, practical insights, and access to FBI resources and connections. Reynolds doesn't always agree with Lightman's ways but stands behind him most of the time.

Dupree initially assisted the Lightman group on a case involving a controversial South Korean ambassador who is presumed to be an assassination target at his son's state wedding.

Her innate talent in the field clashes with Cal's academic approach, and he often shows off by rapidly analyzing her every facial expression. She counters by reading Lightman and, when he least expects it, peppers conversations with quotes from his books.</p><p>It was gradually revealed that Dr. Lightman was driven to study micro-expressions as a result of guilt over his mother's suicide. She claimed to have been fine in order to obtain a weekend pass from a psychiatric ward, when she was actually experiencing agony (which parallels an anecdote in Paul Ekman's book 'Telling Lies').</p><p>For a small number of the early episodes, Lightman would team up with Torres to work on a case, while Foster and Loker would team up on a separate case. Occasionally, their work would intertwine, or Foster and/or Lightman would provide assistance on each other's cases. As the first season progressed, the cases became more involved, and all four of the main characters would work together on one case for each episode.</p><p>In addition to detecting deception in subjects they interview, Lightman and his team also use various interviewing and interrogation tactics to elicit useful information. Rather than by force, they use careful lines of questioning, provocative statements, theatrics and healthy doses of deception on their own part. In the show's pilot episode, Lightman is speaking to a man who is refusing to speak at all, and is able to discern vital information by talking to him and gauging his reaction to each statement.

It gained a score of 64 on Metacritic from 24 reviews.<sup>[22]</sup>Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker awarded <i>Lie to Me</i> a B- rating and wrote '<i>Lie to Me</i> is derivative yet well crafted, predictable yet ever-so-slightly novel… it's no wonder that Fox thinks it's got itself a potential hit'. However, he also commented 'if this review were a face, Dr. Lightman would say it had a forced smile: hopeful, but dubious, about Lie's chances.'<sup>[23]</sup> Tom Shales, writing for the Washington Post, said '<i>Lie to Me</i> seems an unusually meaty, thoughtful and thought-provoking crime drama – another police procedural, yes, but one with a dramatic and mesmerizing difference… easily one of the season's best new shows.'<sup>[24]</sup></p><h3><span>Ratings</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><p>In the United States, the viewing figures declined as the series progressed.
