You can mount them manually with the risks associated with it. (Personally, I have encountered exactly zero bugs/problems in several weeks of hard usage and testing on 3 computers, so I started recommending my method on the net. I am writing this warning anyway, as mounting a partition forcibly may still have unforeseen consequences I have yet to face.)</p><p>Firstly, make sure you have drivers from <strong>6.0</strong> installed, 6.1 does not have HFS+ drivers. You can reinstall to be sure, or</p><ol><li><p>Go to Windowssystem32drivers check if AppleHFS.sys and AppleMNT.sys is there. </p></li><li><p>Run regedit, go check if 'AppleHFS' and 'AppleMNT' keys exist in 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetservices'; each should also have some string and dword values in it.</p></li></ol><p>Personally, I would extract these two .sys files from a 6.0 install, Google on how to install them via registry tweaks, and make the habit of always using the most up-to-date bootcamp drivers. Apart from bug fixing and optimisations, new Macs a few years into future will just not function properly on 6.0 drivers.</p><img src='https://www.fileeagle.com/data/2016/04/Screenshot_1_HFS-for-Windows-8.png' alt='Driver' title='Driver'><p>Reboot after installing your Apple HFS drivers. Nothing will show up on 1607 after reboot, but I would still feel better to install these drivers before we try and mount them.</p><p>Secondly, make sure you are not using CoreStorage. I am reasonably certain 'read only' HFS driver can't do any harm, but it's better to be safe than sorry. </p><p>If you are good to go, you have two options:</p><p>Option #1: mount your bootcamp partition via DOS Devices registry edit:</p><img src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NVqG2qIxvys/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Windows' title='Windows'><ol><li><p>Run regedit, navigate to 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/system/CurrentControlSet/Control/Session Manager/DOS Devices/'</p></li><li><p>Right click &gt; new &gt; add string</p></li><li><p>Enter your drive letter by adding ':' In 'data' type 'DeviceHarddiskVolume#', where # will be the volume number of your partition as it would be detected in MS-DOS. In your case, it SHOULD be 2, as it is the 2nd partition of disk0. (In MY computer, disk0 has 1 partition, my macOS partition is 2nd one on disk1, so MY partition number is 3, just count your partitions starting with 1.)</p><p>Your registry entry should (provided nothing is changed in 4 months you posted this) show 'D:', 'REG_SZ' and 'DeviceHarddiskVolume2' for name, type and data respectively (assuming D: is the drive letter you want for your macOS partition). </p></li><li><p>Never use letter C: or any other drive letter that may contradict with your Windows installation, as this may render your Windows unbootable. (Or may not, it's just a matter of luck whether Windows chooses to mount DOS devices first, or it's own disk management.) It is (probably) safe to do trial and error on volume #, it won't break anything even if you accidentally select your Windows partition, it will just mount it twice with different letters.</p></li><li><p>Reboot and your macOS partition should be there. </p></li><li><p>Before using, go to properties of your new disk in 'This PC' and your 'file system' should be HFS and it should report used and free spaces correctly. If it is RAW, never try to reformat, check your AppleHFS.sys install. </p></li></ol><p>Option #2: use a program that can mount disks via Session Manager (in other words, it will make the registry entries for you). </p><ol><li><p>Download ext2fsd even though you probably have nothing to do with ext2 or linux.</p></li><li><p>Open Ext2 Volume Manager. In 'File System' tab, your macOS partition will show as 'HFS'. If you installed ext2fsd before successfully installing bootcamp drivers, it will just show as 'RAW'. (kind of proving bootcamp drivers DO work)</p></li><li><p>Right click, select assign drive letter (or change drive letter).</p></li><li><p>In the pop-up menu, select the drive letter first, then select the tick 'Create a permanent MountPoint via Session Manager.' It -weirdly- closes the pop-up before you click 'OK'. (Ext2fsd is a little buggy, you should select drive letter first, then select the tickbox. If you want to change drive letter, I suggest removing the existing one first, then re-add it from scratch)</p></li><li><p>Reboot, and the macOS partition will be there just like before anniversary update.</p></li></ol><p>In both options, your diskpart or disk management will still show your HFS partition as RAW, (so does minitool partition wizard etc), but it will function normally, and you should be able to confirm it as HFS in properties menu. In analogy, this method tries to define your partition letter like defining a legacy COM or Printer (LPT) port.</p><h3>Install Hfs Driver Windows 10</h3><div>Andraxxus<span>Andraxxus</span></div><p>Apple officially supports Windows 10 on the newer Macs.
