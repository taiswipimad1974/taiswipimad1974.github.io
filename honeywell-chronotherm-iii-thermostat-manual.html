Very heavy, was quality made. </div></li><li><div><br>It is a very simple t'stat. If the clock still moves it can still be used. There are little blue and red pins that insert into the clock. These pins operate a lever that switches the t'stat from the higher setting to the lower setting. If you notice the two tabs on top where you set the temperature are color coded, the colors are the same for the pins. You put a red pin into the clock for when you want the temp to come up, a blue pin to drop the temp back down.<br>If the clock doesn't operate, the thermostat will still work, it just won't change the temps automatically. </div></li><li><div>thermostat<br>The clock still works.<br>I currently have it set in a range from 62-68 degrees.<br>I have pins at 5am-9am.What I notice is that if its lets say 8am and the system is on, the boiler will keep the temp at around 68 degrees. When does the range I set up, from 62-68 come into play? I was thinking that when it was on, it would cycle up to the high of 68, and then wait till it fell back to 62 to cycle on again. </div></li><li><div><br>No, the 68 is for when you're home, the 62 is for at night or when you're away. The way you have it set now, I think, is the red pin turns the temp up to 68 at 5AM. This is to warm the house before you get up. Then you have a blue pin at 9AM which drops the setting back down to 62. It will stay set at 62 all day and night until 5AM when the red setting takes over again.<br>Most people would have a red pin set for the morning to warm the house before they get up. The at night they set the blue to cool it down for the night. Some also set an interval for when the go out to work and return at the end of the day.<br></div></li><li><div>thermostat revised<br>Yes it works the way you described.The system goes to red (heating ) at 5am then maintains the temp till it turns to blue(non-heat) to 62.<br>How then would you work the thermostat so that when it reached 68, it would not go back on again until it hit the low of 62?<br>If the pins were off the clock, would it work in this manner?? </div></li><li><div><div>Mikey<br>Those are T852 not 8085<br>To Learn More About This Professional, Click Here to Visit Their Ad in 'Find A Professional'</div><div>To learn more about this professional, <b>click here</b> to visit their ad in Find A Contractor.</div></div></li><li><div><br>No, it doesn't work that way. It will just maintain the settings, be they higher or lower. The only way to do that is to set the pins closer, but it still won't go to the lower temp until that time comes up on the clock.<br></div></li><li><div>thermo<br>So if I understand this, the heat setting (red pin) will be maintained during the time frame I had set. The boiler will maintain a temp of 68 degrees during the 'on' time until the blue (off) time comes into play?<br>Also, I notice that when I take the cover off, their are some places where I could make adjustments?<br>Thanks for your help. </div></li><li><div><br>I think you're on the right track. The red pin engages the red temperature setting, the blue pin engages the blue temperature setting. As long as the time is set correctly, that's all you need to know. The other setting you are seeing is probably the heat anticipator and you should not mess with it. </div></li><li><div>thermo<br>I'm glad we had this e-chat.I appreciate your expertise. </div></li><li><div>Honeywell Chronotherm - How is time-of-day set?<br>Indeed, the thermostat is old but durable. It is still operating very well in my mother's house. She can't find the instructions. How is the time-of-day set? Thanks. </div></li><li><div>chrono<br>ON My thermostat, I have hands. You can move the hands to the correct time of day and the wheel under the cover will correspond to the correct time. </div></li><li><div>chronotherm manual<br>Seems like this attached manual might be useful. May not for the exact chronotherm originally mentioned, but should be of use. </div></li><li><div>Chronotherm Clock<br>I have an old chronotherm thermostat as well but the clock does not work. It still turns the furnace on an off but is there any hope of fixing the clock so I can have it turn down the temp at night and up in the morning. </div></li></ul><h2>Comments</h2><img src='http://img0127.psstatic.com/182453284_honeywell-chronotherm-iii-thermostat-t8600c1014-heat-.jpg' alt='Honeywell Chronotherm Iii Thermostat Manual' title='Honeywell Chronotherm Iii Thermostat Manual'><h3 id='honeywell-t8600c1162-thermostat-chronotherm-iii-manual'>Honeywell T8600c1162 Thermostat Chronotherm Iii Manual</h3><ul><li><div>Contact Honeywell below<br>and explain to them that you are looking for a steam thermostat.

I just replaced a broken mercury thermostat with a TH5110 (I got it for about $45). The anticipator in the mercury thermostat was shot as the boiler was cycling every couple of minutes.<br>I picked that thermostat after reading this FAQ:<br>http://www.heatinghelp.com/article/21/Systems-FAQ/43/Steam-systems-Best-thermostats<br>It seems to be working well and does have a 'gravity/steam' configuration setting.<br>Full disclosure - I am not an expert, just a home owner that is new to steam. Good Luck. </div></li><li><div>Mercury thermostat anticipator<br>Are you sure the thermostat was broken? There is very little that can go wrong with the anticipator. It has a very large range of adjustment. In fact yours sounds like it was working too well, if it was causing short cycling.<br>By moving the adjustment up to the 1.2 setting you could effectively defeat the anticipator and produce very long heating cycles. </div></li><li><div>I believe so<br>The temperature never got above 56 on the thermostat even though it was set to 62, and regardless of where the anticipator was set the boiler cycled very couple of mins.<br>With the new thermostat the temperature is where it should be and the boiler runs much longer. </div></li><li><div>What is the correct anticipator setting<br>What is the correct anticipator setting for a steam system.
