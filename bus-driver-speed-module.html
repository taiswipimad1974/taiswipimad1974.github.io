I wanted one to be used by Dom-0, and the other to be used by a VM, so I needed the device to be available to xen-pciback. However, the usb driver was complied into my kernel, so I couldn't just blacklist the driver. My solution was to create a custom initramfs script that unbinds the specific pci port very early in the boot process.</p><p>This is Ubuntu 2016.04, but it should work in earlier versions.</p><p>There are three files involved. I named them for my specific use case, but ymmv:</p><img src='http://www.cooking-hacks.com/media/cooking/images/documentation/CANBus/canbus_top_diagram_small.jpg' alt='Bus Driver Speed Module' title='Bus Driver Speed Module'><p>The first file, named <code>/etc/unbindpci</code> file which is a simple csv of the pci device number and the driver (configure as needed here):</p><p>Second file <code>/etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/xenfiles</code>, which copies the above config into the initramfs.</p><p>Third file is what does the work at boot time, I placed it in <code>/etc/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/unbind-early-pci</code>:</p><p>Finally, run <code>update-initramfs -k all -u</code> and reboot.</p><p>I could include support for comments in the config file, and there is a lot of cleanup to do here, but it works for me.</p><div>Steve Czetty<span>Steve Czetty</span></div><p>None of the answers solved my similar problem, but they did put me on the path to solving it!</p><p>My syslog error:</p><p>This is an internal usb hub-port for a bluetooth option I do not have. </p><p>unbind to the pci device just resulted in the hub popping back up as another hub (5 in my case) and flooding syslog further.</p><p>By chance I noticed an unbind structure under <code>/sys/bus/usb/drivers/hub</code>.

I tried it with an usb thumb drive and it worked (meaning it remained disabled) as long as the drive was plugged.
